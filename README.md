# Clinical Decision Support System with Deep Learning (Natural Language Processing)

This project focuses on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) section of the clinical decision supporting system for cardio-pneumological diseases, in collaboration with the Third Eye Intelligence, as part of the Bachelor Year Group Project of MEng Biomedical Engineering (Computational Bioengineering), Imperial College London.

In this section, we aim to fine-tune the BERT-based [Bio+ClinicalBERT](https://huggingface.co/emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT) onto all radiology reports available on the [MIMIC-CXR Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/) such that our models can understand and be able to classify different diagnoses between reports.  Codes for our deep learning models are witten in Python and implemented with PyTorch 1.7.1.
